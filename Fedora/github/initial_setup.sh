# When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/YOU/.ssh/id_ALGORITHM): ", you can press Enter to accept the default file location. Please note that if you created SSH keys previously, ssh-keygen may ask you to rewrite another key, in which case we recommend creating a custom-named SSH key. To do so, type the default file location and replace id_ALGORITHM with your custom key name
